## Overview

This project, named "Restaurant Management," is a robust Spring Boot application designed for managing restaurant data efficiently. It provides a set of RESTful API endpoints that allow you to perform various operations on user records, such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting user information. 

## Technologies Used

- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Language:** Java
- **Build Tool:** Maven

## Data Flow

### Controller

The Controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and delegating them to the appropriate services. It defines API endpoints for the following operations:

1. **Add Restaurant:** `POST /restaurant`
2. **Add Restaurants:** `POST /restaurant`
3. **Get All Restaurants:** `GET /restaurant`
4. **Get Restaurant by ID:** `GET /restaurant/{id}`
5. **Update Restaurant Speciality by Id:** `PUT /restaurant/{id}/id/speciality`
7. **Delete Restaurant by ID:** `DELETE /restaurant/{id}`

```java
@RestController
public class RestaurantController {
    @Autowired
    RestaurantService restaurantService;

    //Add restaurant:

    @PostMapping("restaurant")
    public String addRestaurant(@RequestBody Restaurant newRestaurant){
       return restaurantService.addRestaurant(newRestaurant);
    }


    // get Restaurant:

    @GetMapping("restaurant/id/{id}")
    public Restaurant getRestaurantById(@PathVariable Integer id){
        return restaurantService.getRestaurantById(id);
    }
```

## Services

The Services layer implements the core business logic, data processing, and interaction with the data repository. Key responsibilities include:

- Validating input data.
- Performing CRUD operations on user data.
- Handling data transformations and interactions with external systems (if applicable).

```java
@Service
public class RestaurantService {
    @Autowired
    IRestaurant iRestaurant;


    public String addRestaurants(List<Restaurant> newRestaurants) {
        iRestaurant.saveAll(newRestaurants);
        return newRestaurants.size()+" restaurant added";
    }

    public List<Restaurant> getAllRestaurants() {
       return (List<Restaurant>) iRestaurant.findAll();
    }

    public String addRestaurant(Restaurant newRestaurant) {
        iRestaurant.save(newRestaurant);
        return "room added";
    }
```

## Repository

The Repository layer manages data access to the underlying database. It handles database operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) for user data. Additionally, it may include data mapping and conversion between Java objects and database entities.

```java
@Repository
public interface IRestaurant extends CrudRepository<Restaurant,Integer> {
    
}
```


## Database Design

The project's database design includes tables for user management, with fields such as:

- `restaurantId` (User ID)
- `restaurantName` (User Name)
- `restaurantNumber` (Restaurant Number)
- `Speciality` (Restauant Speciality)
- `restauranttNumber` (Phone Number)

## Data Structures Used

The project utilizes the following data structures:

### ArrayList

The project utilizes the `ArrayList` data structure to store and manage lists of `Restaurant` objects in various parts of the application. `ArrayList` provides dynamic sizing and efficient element retrieval, making it suitable for storing user records and performing operations on them.

These data structures enable the application to organize and manipulate user data efficiently while maintaining data integrity.


## Project Summary

The Restaurant Management project is a robust Spring Boot application designed for efficient user data management. It offers a set of RESTful API endpoints for various user-related operations, including adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting user information.

### Key Technologies Used

- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Language:** Java
- **Build Tool:** Maven

### Data Flow

#### Controller

The Controller layer handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate services. It defines API endpoints for operations such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting user records.

#### Services

The Services layer implements core business logic and data processing, including input validation, CRUD operations on user data, and data transformations.

#### Repository

The Repository layer manages data access to the underlying database, performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for user data.

#### Database Design

The database design includes tables for restaurant management, featuring fields like `restaurantId`, `restaurantName`, `speciality`, `restaurantContactNo` .


### Key Features

- RESTful API endpoints for restaurant management.
- Clean code separation with a layered architecture (Controller, Services, Repository).
- Robust error handling for improved reliability.
- Java-based backend and Maven for build management.

The restaurant Management project serves as a practical example of Spring Boot application development, demonstrating best practices in API design and user data management. It offers a solid foundation for building and extending restaurant management systems in various applications.
